# ASRI-Data-Analysis-code
Code written during 2023 Arkansas Summer Research Institute to manipulate data and do basic analysis. 

That's basically what it is... 
I wrote these scripts to get results and present my findings on Ethnic Diversity, Household Size, and Poverty in the US during the 2023 Arkansas Summer Research Institute (was also during summer of my sophomore year)

Dataset used is the Rural_Economy dataset, which should be publicly available. (Was given this data by the ASRI...)
